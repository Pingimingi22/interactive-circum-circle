# About
In my programming class we learned how that if you draw three dots there will always be a circle whose perimeter will hit all three of the dots. I wanted to try program a simple visualisation myself and I'm pretty happy with the results. I decided to use Javascript and Three.js so that I could display it online on my website.

# Disclaimer
The project currently wont work if you directly get it off the repo. It is hooked up to work on my website and so if you want to get it up and running you will have to remove the hardcoded reference to the canvas element.
